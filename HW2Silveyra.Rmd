I started by reading the data from "GSE17274.ReadCountPerLane.csv" 

```{r}
myData=read.csv("GSE17274_ReadCountPerLane.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
```

Next, I checked the number of rows and columns  

```{r}
dim(myData)
```

next the headers of the 36 columns

```{r}
colnames(myData)
```

I printed the first 5 rows to make sure that the data were read in properly. 

```{r}
head(myData,5)
```

I obtained the gene-wise total reads

```{r}
GeneTotal=rowSums(myData[2:37])
```

to avoid taking logarithms of zeroes, I added a small constant to all numbers, and I got the histogram of total reads per gene (applying logarithm) and changed the main title and color

```{r}
hist(log2(GeneTotal+0.25), nclass=50, main="Total Reads", col="yellow")
```

Then I counted the number of genes with zero reads

```{r}
sum(GeneTotal==0)
```

Record the Session Information. 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
